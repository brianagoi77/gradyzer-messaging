Key Components Explained

gradyzer-messaging.php → Main plugin file. Registers custom post type (gradyzer_message), endpoints, enqueues assets, handles activation logic, and loads all modules.

css/style.css → Contains all frontend styles for the inbox layout, unread/read message blocks, thread display, reply form, and notification bubble. Responsive and polished.

js/script.js → Handles dynamic thread loading, reply submission via AJAX, auto-refresh of threads and bubble every 10 seconds, and click behavior for unread messages.

includes/shortcodes.php → Defines [gradyzer_inbox] for rendering the unified inbox layout, and [gradyzer_notification] for showing the unread message bubble.

includes/class-message-controller.php → REST API controller that exposes endpoints for fetching message threads and posting replies. Used by the JS for dynamic updates.

includes/hooks.php → (Optional) Contains custom WordPress hooks and filters for extensibility. Useful for integrating with other plugins or adding custom logic.

includes/admin-page.php → (Optional) Admin settings page for configuring plugin behavior, refresh intervals, or UI options. Can be extended for future customization.


WordPress Pages Created

Your plugin sets up a seamless messaging experience with two powerful shortcodes:

/inbox   [gradyzer_inbox] → Renders the full threaded inbox layout, combining message previews, real-time threads, and reply functionality in one elegant interface.

Anywhere (menu, header, widget)   [gradyzer_notification] → Displays a dynamic message bubble showing the current unread count. Clicking it opens the latest unread thread instantly, keeping users engaged and informed.

These shortcodes turn any WordPress site into a responsive, real-time messaging hub — no extra configuration required.
